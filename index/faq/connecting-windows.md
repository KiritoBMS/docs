### Getting started

- Register an account
- Download server switcher
- Extract switcher somewhere (eg: on your desktop)
- Turn off your antivirus (some antiviruses might cause some issues)

### Certificate installation

If you want to play on Verge using stable/beta/cutting edge osu! client, you must install our HTTPS certificate. This is one time operation and won't affect anything.

- Open the switcher
- Click on “Install certificate”
- Click on “Yes”

### If you can’t install the certificate properly, follow these instructions to install it manually.

- Download certificate file from [here](https://example.com/)
- Open the downloaded file
- Click on "Install Certificate"
- Select "Current User" and click on "Next"
- Select "Place all certificates in the following store" and then click on "Browse"
- Select "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" from list and click on "Ok"
- Click on "Next" until you reach the end of the process
- **NOTE** If the import wizard asks asks you about anything, click on "Yes"

### How to play on Verge

- Run the switcher as administrator
- Make sure that the switcher says “You are playing on Verge Server"; if not, click “On/Off” to switch server.
- Open osu! and login with your Verge account
- **NOTE** If you can't connect to Verge, make sure to click on "Update IP" to obtain correct servers' IP addresses

### How to play on official osu! again

- Make sure osu! is closed
- Open the switcher and make sure it says “You are playing on osu! server” (it should look like this), if not, click “On/Off” to switch server.
- Open osu! and login with your osu! account
- **NOTE** If you want to connect to [osu.ppy.sh](https://osu.ppy.sh/) and you still see Verge website even if the switcher is off, empty your browser cache.

### How to update osu!/switch release branch

- Make sure osu! is closed
- Open the switcher and make sure it says “You are playing on osu! server”
